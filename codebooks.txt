after downloading zip file and expanding it, there will be 2 main folders {test , train} 
in addition to reference files

here is an explanation of variables used in the run_analysis.R

columnsNames            :  is the column names existing in features.txt file , these column names will be used to assign names to data frames

#######################Test set#################
activityLabelDataFrame  :  is a data frame holding activities from activity_labels.txt

subjecttestDataFrame    :  contains data (1 column) representing subject

testActivities          :  contains data (1 column) representing activity id

columnWidths            :  is a vector to enable reading fixed width format file

testDataFrame           :  contains the core test data  from file { x_test.txt}


#######################Train set#################
activityLabelDataFrame  :  is a data frame holding activities from activity_labels.txt

subjectTrainDataFrame    :  contains data (1 column) representing subject

TrainActivities          :  contains data (1 column) representing activity id

TrainDataFrame           :  contains the core Train data  from file { x_Train.txt}

#######################  union
cleanColumnNames         :  vector of column names after removing whitespaces and -   , appending to it "subject" and "activity"

stdAndMeanColumnNames    :  vector of column names those include std or mean in it.


unionDataFrame           :  is the union between 2 data frames test and train

stdAndmeanDataframe      :  is part of union data frame with column names include std or mean.

#######################  grouping
groups1                  :  is the grouping of stdAndmeanDataframe based on subject and activity 
result                   :  is the average of groups in groups1
result2                  :  subset of result to exclude activity and subject
